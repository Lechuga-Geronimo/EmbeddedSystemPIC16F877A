# Design-and-Construction-of-an-Embedded-System-based-on-PIC-16F877A

## Year: 2012. 

## Objective. 

To design and construct an embedded system with multiports, serial communication and capable of activate relay-outputs and optocouplers for different loads.

## Description. 

An embedded system is a powerful electronic device capable of conducting complex tasks. For example, communicate with other devices through serial communication, activate outputs for AC or DC motors, perform convertion operations (ADC, DAC) and make use of features such watchdogs. In this project, an embedded system is intended to perform mentioned tasks, using a micrcontroller PIC 16F877A thanks to its powerful properties.

## Design.

The software chosen is LiveWire.

## Construction.

The embedded system was build on a one-sided PCB of glass fiber. 
A manual manufacturing, assembly, soldering and testing was performed. 

Among the characteristics: 

* 6 relay-outputs.
* 1 LED bar to show state of inputs.
* 40 headers for inputs and inputs in all GPIO.
* 2 hearders for Quartz replacement.
* 1 master restart push button.
* 1 port for ICSP communication, so its not necessary to remove and place the PIC again with every reprogramming.
* 1 port for I2C communication.
